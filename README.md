# Reward Points Calculator

## Project Overview

A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.

A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.

(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).   Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.

Assumption:- The record could be of many years so displaying the records of the latest three months in descending order and combined points as per customer ID for the last three months.
